```(dev,test,local)```

To be able to use a DB you must use one of the previous enviroments in your script like this:


```npm run dev -- --enviroment=test``` for testing

```npm run dev -- --enviroment=dev``` for dev

apply the same thing for other scripts like ``npm test`` or ``npm start``


TO BE ADDED: 

```npm run dev -- --enviroment=local``` for local
